NAME
    ExtUtils::Typemap - Read/Write/Modify Perl/XS typemap files

SYNOPSIS
    See "ExtUtils::Typemaps" instead!

DESCRIPTION
    This module exists merely as a compatibility wrapper around
    ExtUtils::Typemaps. In a nutshell, "ExtUtils::Typemap" was renamed to
    "ExtUtils::Typemaps" because the Typemap directory in lib/ could collide
    with the typemap file on case-insensitive file systems.

    The "ExtUtils::Typemaps" module is part of the ExtUtils::ParseXS
    distribution and ships with the standard library of perl starting with
    perl version 5.16.

SEE ALSO
    ExtUtils::Typemaps, ExtUtils::ParseXS.

    For details on typemaps: perlxstut, perlxs.
